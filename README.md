# CodeGen LLM: Building a Code Generation Language Model from Scratch

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of creating a **Code Generation Large Language Model (LLM)**. From dataset collection to deployment, you'll find everything needed to build and deploy a transformer-based LLM for generating code snippets.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Collection**: Scripts to scrape data from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and programming documentation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, cleaning, and structuring for training.
- **Training**: Fine-tuning a transformer-based architecture (e.g., GPT-2).
- **Deployment**: FastAPI-based API for serving code generation, containerized with Docker and scalable via Kubernetes.
- **Cloud Integration**: Use AWS S3 for storing and retrieving datasets.

📋 Getting Started

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.9+
	•	Docker
	•	AWS CLI (for S3 integration)
	•	Kubernetes (optional for scaling)

Installation

1.	Clone the repository:

		git clone https://github.com/your-username/codegen-llm.git
		cd codegen-llm


2.	Install dependencies:

		pip install -r requirements.txt

🛠️ Usage

1. Data Collection

Run scripts to scrape data:

	python scripts/scrape_github.py
	python scripts/scrape_stackoverflow.py
	python scripts/scrape_docs.py

2. Data Preprocessing

	Preprocess the raw data for training:

		python scripts/preprocess_data.py

3. Model Training

	Fine-tune the model using your dataset:

		python scripts/train_model.py

4. Deployment

	Start the FastAPI server:

		cd api
		uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

🚢 Deployment with Docker

1.	Build the Docker image:

		docker build -t codegen-api .


2.	Run the container:

		docker run -p 8000:8000 codegen-api

⚙️ Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy the API on Kubernetes:
	
		kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

📈 Future Enhancements

•	Support for additional programming languages.
•	Model optimization with quantization and pruning.
•	Enhanced dataset filtering and augmentation.
